1. We decided to create the basic outline of our website. We wanted basic login, logout, register implementations. Other things like headers and footers as well just for a quick baseline to work from.

2. Decided to alter what people were doing due to communication mistakes. 

3.
Tayden: Create Friends and users_to_leaderboards tables, create footer, create login html
Oliver: Created sql tables and added the partial for navbar
Noah: Added functionality for users to register and login. Started social page by allowing users to send friend requests
Jaden: added profile tab redirects 
Brandon: Created home page
Joe: Create logout functionality and clean up index.js file
