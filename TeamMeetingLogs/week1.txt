1. We decided to focus on functionality more for this week. We are adding some routing and functionality to our project mainly through the social page and the challenge aspect of our game. We also are cleaning up some of the pages visually and creating the html for our actual game.

2. Decided to change some of the social page functionality and design. Decided to alter the users table to use username as the primary key instead of the user_id.
